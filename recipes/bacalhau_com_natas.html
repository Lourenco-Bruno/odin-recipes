            apart in big chunks.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Start by cooking the potatoes I personally do not care much for the shell. But you can peel the potatoes<br>
            and bring to bake in warm water until they are good. No need to cook too because then how will the oven
            may<br>
            end there is still need of a minutes to be in point.</li>
        <br>
        <li>However in a frying pan put the onion cut into thin slices with a little olive oil<br>
            with crushed garlic cloves and let it cook until the onion browned.<br>
            After joining the cod, test and rectifies with salt and pepper.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Joins the prepared milk and cream and a tablespoon of butter and a pinch of nutmeg and let<br>
            the sauce thicken a little,<br>
            test to see if you need to adjust, as is the taste, remove from heat.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Strain out the potatoes and cut them into cubes and pour with the cod mixture and involves well.<br>
            Then put it on a tray or baking dish to bring to a preheated oven hot to<br>
            about 200ÂªC enough only for browning the top and is ready!</li>
